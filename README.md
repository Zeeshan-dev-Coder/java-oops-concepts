Java OOPs Concepts

This project demonstrates the core concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) in Java using a simple employee management example.
It covers classes, objects, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, constructors, and getter/setter methods.


---

📌 Features & Concepts Covered

Class & Object → Defined Employee, Manager, and Developer classes, and created objects for them.

Encapsulation → Used private fields with public getter/setter methods.

Inheritance → Manager and Developer extend the Employee base class.

Polymorphism → Method overriding (different implementations in child classes).

Constructors → Default and parameterized constructors to initialize objects.

▶ How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Zeeshan-dev-Coder/java-oops-concepts.git


2. Open the project in any IDE (IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code / Eclipse).


3. Navigate to:

src/com/upgrade/demo2/UsageEmployee.java


4. Run the program, and see how different classes interact using OOPs principles.

📝 Example Output

When you run the program, you will see:

Employee details displayed

Different behavior of Manager and Developer objects

Demonstration of encapsulation and polymorphism

✅ Learning Outcome

By going through this project, you will understand how to implement the four pillars of OOPs in Java:

1. Encapsulation


2. Inheritance


3. Polymorphism


4. Abstraction (partially via method overriding)
